# F3 Nation - PNPM Turbo Monorepo

This is a monorepo that is built with PNPM workspaces and Turbo for managing multiple applications and shared packages.

## Monorepo Fundamentals

### Working with the Root Directory

The root directory contains configuration files that govern the entire monorepo:

- **`package.json`**: Root-level dependencies and scripts
- **`pnpm-workspace.yaml`**: Defines workspace packages (apps and packages directories)
- **`turbo.json`**: Turbo configuration for task orchestration, caching, and pipeline definitions
- **Root-level commands** affect all workspaces unless filtered

### Working with Application Directories

Each application in the `apps/` directory is a self-contained project:

- **Individual `package.json`**: Application-specific dependencies and scripts
- **Independent development**: Can be run separately from other apps
- **Shared code access**: Can import from shared packages in the monorepo
- **Port configuration**: Each app typically runs on its own port

### Using Filter Flags with PNPM Commands

PNPM provides powerful filtering capabilities to target specific workspaces:

#### Installation Filtering

```bash
# Install dependencies for all workspaces
pnpm install

# Install dependencies for a specific app
pnpm install --filter f3-map

# Install dependencies for multiple specific apps
pnpm install --filter f3-map --filter another-app

# Install dependencies for all apps
pnpm install
```

#### Development Filtering

```bash
# Start development server for all apps
pnpm dev

# Start development server for specific app
pnpm dev --filter f3-map

# Start development server with custom turbo flags
pnpm dev --filter f3-map -- --port 3001
```

#### Build Filtering

```bash
# Build all workspaces
pnpm build

# Build specific app
pnpm build --filter f3-map
```

#### Other Useful Filter Patterns

```bash
# Run tests for specific workspace
pnpm test --filter f3-map

# Run linting for specific workspace
pnpm lint --filter f3-map

```

### Turbo Configuration

The `turbo.json` file defines the build pipeline and task dependencies for the monorepo. It enables:

- **Task pipelines**: Define how tasks (dev, build, test, lint) depend on each other
- **Caching strategy**: Configure what files and outputs should be cached
- **Environment variables**: Specify which env vars affect task outputs for caching
- **Output logging**: Control what gets logged during task execution

### Turbo Cache Benefits

The monorepo leverages Turbo's caching system:

- **Incremental builds**: Only rebuild what changed
- **Remote caching**: Share cache across team members and CI
- **Parallel execution**: Run tasks concurrently when possible
- **Dependency graph**: Smart task ordering based on dependencies

## Setup

1. **Clone the repository**:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/F3-Nation/f3-nation.git && cd f3-nation
   ```

2. **Enable Corepack** (ships with Node.js 16+, manages package manager versions):

   ```bash
   corepack enable
   ```

3. **Install dependencies**:

   ```bash
   pnpm install
   ```

4. **Environment setup**:

   - Get env.zip from F3 Nation Slack
   - Unzip and rename to `.env`
   - **Important**: Environment variables are application-specific. Place the `.env` file in the appropriate application directory, not the monorepo root
   - For the map app: place in `apps/map/.env`
   - See [F3 Nation Map README](apps/map/README.md) for app-specific setup details

5. **Start development**:

   ```bash
   # Start all apps
   pnpm dev

   # Start specific app only
   pnpm dev --filter f3-map
   ```

## Application Registry

### Current Applications

| Application          | Directory     | Port | Description                                                                                        |
| -------------------- | ------------- | ---- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **F3 Nation Map**    | `apps/map/`   | 3000 | Interactive map application for F3 Nation locations and events - [README](apps/map/README.md)      |

### Future Applications (Planned)

_Additional applications will be added to this registry as they are developed_

## Package Registry

### Shared Packages

| Package        | Directory              | Description                                 |
| -------------- | ---------------------- | ------------------------------------------- |
| **API**        | `packages/api/`        | Backend API routes and ORPC routers         |
| **Auth**       | `packages/auth/`       | Authentication utilities and configurations |
| **DB**         | `packages/db/`         | Database client, schema, and migrations     |
| **Shared**     | `packages/shared/`     | Common utilities and shared logic           |
| **UI**         | `packages/ui/`         | Reusable UI components                      |
| **Validators** | `packages/validators/` | Data validation schemas                     |

## Environment Variables

Environment variables are application-specific in this monorepo. The `.env` file should be placed in the application directory (e.g., `apps/map/`) rather than the monorepo root.

## Development Workflow

1. **Make changes** in the appropriate app or package directory
2. **Test locally** using filter flags to run only what you need
3. **Lint and test** before committing:
   ```bash
   pnpm lint --filter <your-workspace>
   pnpm test --filter <your-workspace>
   ```
4. **Commit changes** - Turbo will handle optimal task execution

# DB Commands

- For dev migrations use the `dev_generic` user
- For staging migrations use the `dev_generic` user
- For production migrations use the `f3slackbot` user

# WIP

- ensure we can't submit with no time and no events for new events
- add tests for approvals in the admin portal
- test image issues
- better text of where we're moving aos and regions
- decide which things you can change region and which you can't
- TODO: Think through AO and location appearance
